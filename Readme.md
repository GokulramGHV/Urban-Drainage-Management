# Urban Drainage Management
Application link: https://gokulramghv.github.io/Urban-Drainage-Management/

Mini Project for the UIT1412-PDS course.         
Using this web application you can find the nearest sewage treatement plant for any of the houses in the city so that the waste from the houses can be transported efficently.

## Instructions
- To add a house node using the `Graph editor` just add the prefix `h-`
  Example `h-House1`      
          
- To add a sewage plant node, just add the prefix `p-` to the node name
  Example `p-Plant1`
  
- A junction node can be added without adding any prefix to the node's name
